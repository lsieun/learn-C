# library

C divides the C function library into **families of related functions** and provides **a header file** for **each family**. For example, `printf()` and `scanf()` belong to a family of standard input and output functions and use the `stdio.h` header file. The `strlen()` function joins several other string-related functions, such as functions to copy strings and to search through strings, in a family served by the string.h header.

## string.h

The `string.h` file contains function prototypes for several string-related functions, including `strlen()`.
