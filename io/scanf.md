# scanf

The `scanf()` function provides keyboard input to the program.

```c
float weight;
/* get input from the user */
scanf("%f", &weight);
```

The `%f` instructs `scanf()` to read a floating-point number from the keyboard, and the `&weight` tells `scanf()` to assign the input value to the variable named `weight`. The `scanf()` function uses the `&` notation to indicate where it can find the `weight` variable.
