# CMakeLists

CMake is controlled by writing instructions in `CMakeLists.txt` files. Each directory in your project should have a `CMakeLists.txt` file.

What is nice about CMake is that `CMakeLists.txt` files in a sub-directory inherit properties set in the parent directory, reducing the amount of code duplication.
